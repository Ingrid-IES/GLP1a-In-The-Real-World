This is a new draft in which I will merge HP and EHR data with the VITALS table earlier on, so that there are not conflicting "First Dispense Dates" per patient STUDY_ID. 

The outline/gameplan for what to filter and merge and when:

##Read in: 

* dispensing table
* hp_dispensing table


## From dispensing tables:

* filter only the NDC codes for GLP1a

### JOIN EHR AND HP DISPENSING DATA


## Read in:

* enrollment table
* hp_enrollment table


## From enrollment tables:

* convert ENR_START_DATE and ENR_END_DATE to dates

### JOIN EHR AND HP ENROLLMENT DATA


## JOIN DISPENSING AND ENROLLMENT DATA 

## JOIN DF WITH VITALS

* convert DISPENSE_DATE and MEASURE_DATE to dates

Then,

* Calculate difference in weeks between ENR_START_DATE and ENR_END_DATE to get totalEnrollWeeks
* Find first dispense date per patient
* Calculate difference in weeks between firstDispDate and ENR_END_DATE to get firstDispToEnrollEnd
* Filter only observations who have 68+ weeks for firstDispToEnrollEnd
* Create variable for 68 weeks elapsed from firstDispDate, call it firstDispPlus68

## JOIN DF WITH VITALS

## Select only relevant dispensing variables
```{r}
dispensing <- dispensing %>% select(STUDY_ID, DISPENSE_DATE)
hp_dispensing <- hp_dispensing %>% select(STUDY_ID, DISPENSE_DATE)
```


## Compare dispense dates per STUDY_ID
```{r}
dispensing %>% distinct(STUDY_ID)
hp_dispensing %>% distinct(STUDY_ID)
```



```{r}



intersect(dispensing %>% distinct(STUDY_ID), hp_dispensing %>% distinct(STUDY_ID))


intersect(dispensing, hp_dispensing)




```






## Combine EHR and HP dispensing tables
```{r}
all_dispense <- bind_rows(dispensing, hp_dispensing)
```

## Reading in enrollment and hp_enrollment
```{r warning = F, message = F}
enroll <- read_csv("PATH_JING_LUO_ENROLLMENT_2020_03_31.csv")
hp_enroll <- read_csv("PATH_JING_LUO_HP_ENROLLMENT_2020_03_31.csv")
```

Convert character to date for `ENR_START_DATE` and `ENR_END_DATE`
```{r}
enroll$ENR_START_DATE <- as.Date(enroll$ENR_START_DATE, "%m/%d/%Y")
enroll$ENR_END_DATE <- as.Date(enroll$ENR_END_DATE, "%m/%d/%Y")

hp_enroll$ENR_START_DATE <- as.Date(hp_enroll$ENR_START_DATE, "%m/%d/%Y")
hp_enroll$ENR_END_DATE <- as.Date(hp_enroll$ENR_END_DATE, "%m/%d/%Y")
```

### Both the EHR and HP data have unique enrollment time frames per unique patient.
```{r}
enroll %>% arrange(STUDY_ID)
enroll %>% distinct(STUDY_ID)

hp_enroll %>% arrange(STUDY_ID)
hp_enroll %>% distinct(STUDY_ID)
```
### The intersection between EHR and HP enrollment data
```{r}
intersect(enroll, hp_enroll) %>% nrow()

intersect(enroll$STUDY_ID, hp_enroll$STUDY_ID) %>% data.frame() %>% nrow()
```
There are only 7 observations that have identical STUDY_IDs and enrollment dates between EHR and HP.
Meanwhile, there are 14,040 overlapping STUDY_IDs for the EHR and HP enrollment tables.

Since there are 14,040 distinct STUDY_IDs in HP and 14,597 distinct STUDY_IDs in EHR, we can assume that all of the STUDY_IDs in HP are also in EHR. 

Thus, we will only use the EHR data for enrollment start and end.
