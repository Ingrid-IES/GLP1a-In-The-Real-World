# GLP1a-In-The-Real-World
A work in progress of the long-winded process of using R to clean data and gathering cohort statistics to inform a retrospective study measuring the primary outcome of weight loss over time. 


The different raw data tables used in the analyses are from the PCORnet relational database. 
Tables include:

- Demographics
- Death
- Enrollment
- Encounter
- Dispensing
- Condition
- Diagnosis
- Procedures
- Lab Results
- Vital


The raw data is not included for confidentiality purposes. 

Tidyverse is used ad nauseum since it is vastly versatile for data querying and cleaning. 

This work is highly iterative and a constantly changing process. Not just in trial-and-error/learning, but in the sense that the study is constantly revised based on new collections of counts and discoveries in the data. Hence the multiple drafts... (though I would like to think that the drafts improve in quality as they continue)
