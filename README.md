# GLP1a-In-The-Real-World
A work in progress of the long-winded process of using R to clean data and gathering cohort statistics to inform a retrospective study measuring the primary outcome of weight loss over time. 


The different raw data tables used in the analyses are from the PCORnet relational database. 
Tables include:

- Demographics
- Death
- Enrollment
- Encounter
- Dispensing
- Condition
- Diagnosis
- Procedures
- Lab Results
- Vital


The raw data is not included for confidentiality purposes. 

Tidyverse is used ad nauseum since it is vastly versatile for data querying and cleaning.
