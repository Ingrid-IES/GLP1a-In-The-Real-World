# New to this draft:
-	Use robâ€™s code to include a bunch of other demographic variables

- only 18+ year olds

-	Change enrollment criteria to 72 + weeks

-	Everyone in df should have at least one weigh in (-8, 0] and at least one weight in (0, 68], where 0 = firstDispDate

-	Make potentially erroneous weights to NA

- Time windows

```

```{r}

7006 distinct patients dispensed a GLP1a and have enroll-demographic-death information

## Creating column for FIRST dispensement date per patient
## also in disp_enroll2, we will get rid of less relevant variables (22)
```{r}

disp_enroll2
```
```{r}
disp_enroll2 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID)
disp_enroll2 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID, firstDispDate)
```
Good, each distinct patient has their own unique first dispense date.

** code for looking at firstDispDates that fall outside of the enrollment time range is in line 188 of Draft 5 **

## Create a column for 68 weeks after the first dispensement date
```{r}
disp_enroll2$firstDispPlus68W = disp_enroll2$firstDispDate + weeks(68)

disp_enroll2 %>% select(STUDY_ID, DISPENSE_DATE, firstDispDate, firstDispPlus68W, ENR_START_DATE, ENR_END_DATE, drug)

# Now create the following time frames:

* -60 days of firstDispDate

* -90 days of firstDispDate

* +14 days of firstDispDate

* ENR_START_DATE (already have)

```{r}

         firstDispMinus60D = firstDispDate - days(60),
         firstDispMinus90D = firstDispDate - days(90),
         firstDispPlus14D = firstDispDate + days(14))
```

## Create a column for the number of weeks between first dispensement date and end of enrollment
```{r}
disp_enroll3$firstDispToEndW = difftime(disp_enroll3$ENR_END_DATE, disp_enroll3$firstDispDate, units = "weeks") %>% as.numeric()

disp_enroll3
```
## Filter so that only 72+ firstDispToEndW are included
```{r}
disp_enroll4 <- disp_enroll3 %>% filter(firstDispToEndW >= 72)

disp_enroll4

```
4435 distinct patients dispensed GLP1a, have enrollment info, and have 72+ weeks between first dispense date and end of enrollment.


## Read in vital table
```{r warning = F, message = F}
ehr_vital = read_csv("Excel_Data/PATH_JING_LUO_VITAL_2020_03_31.csv")
ehr_vital
ehr_vital %>% distinct(STUDY_ID)
```
971,891 rows, 14590 distinct patients in vital table.

```{r}
colSums(is.na(ehr_vital))
```
### Convert MEASURE_DATE to a date
```{r}
ehr_vital$MEASURE_DATE = as.Date(ehr_vital$MEASURE_DATE, "%m/%d/%Y")
```


### First, keep only patients that have both WT and ORIGINAL_BMI values
```{r}
ehr_vital1 = ehr_vital %>% drop_na(WT, ORIGINAL_BMI); ehr_vital1

ehr_vital1 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID)
```
424,844 rows, 14528 distinct patients with vital info (including WT and ORIGINAL_BMI).

```{r}
colSums(is.na(ehr_vital1))
```

Since there are 424,844 rows in ehr_vital1 and 424,844 NA values for SMOKING, TOBACCO, TOBACCO_TYPE, RAW_VITAL_SOURCE, RAW_TOBACCO, RAW_TOBACCO_TYPE, and RAW_SMOKING, we will remove these variables.

We will remove variables so that all that remain are STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE, WT, ORIGINAL_BMI, DIASTOLIC, and SYSTOLIC. 

```{r}
ehr_vital2 = ehr_vital1 %>% select(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE, WT, ORIGINAL_BMI, DIASTOLIC, SYSTOLIC); ehr_vital2

ehr_vital2 = distinct(ehr_vital2); ehr_vital2
ehr_vital2 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID)
```
419,505 rows, 14528 distinct patients with complete vitals info (BMI, WT, and MEASURE_DATE).



## Join disp_enroll4 with ehr_vital2
```{r}
left_join(disp_enroll4, ehr_vital2, by = "STUDY_ID")
```
## Check out NA values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(left_join(disp_enroll4, ehr_vital2, by = "STUDY_ID")))
```
Since MEASURE_DATE, WT, and ORIGINAL_BMI are important for our study, we will perform an inner join instead so that each patient can have complete information.

```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals = inner_join(disp_enroll4, ehr_vital2, by = "STUDY_ID")

disp_enroll_vitals
```
## Check out NA values
```{r}
colSums(is.na(disp_enroll_vitals))
```
Good, now we have MEASURE_DATE, WT, and ORIGINAL_BMI.

```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals
distinct(disp_enroll_vitals)


disp_enroll_vitals1 = distinct(disp_enroll_vitals)
```
2,512,805 rows and 4420 distinct patients with 
- dispensed a GLP1a
- have enrollment info
- 72+ weeks between first dispensement and end of enrollment
- have complete vital info (BMI & WT)


## Flag unusual/potentially erroneous WTs and BMIs
```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals2 = disp_enroll_vitals1 %>%
  mutate(
    below70WT = ifelse(WT < 70, 1, 0),
    above700WT = ifelse(WT > 700, 1, 0),
    below15BMI = ifelse(ORIGINAL_BMI < 15, 1, 0),
    above90BMI = ifelse(ORIGINAL_BMI > 90, 1, 0)
    )

disp_enroll_vitals2

```
## Flag MEASURE_DATES that are between weeks (0 , 68])
## Also flag MEASURE_DATEs that are between weeks (-8,0]
```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals3 = disp_enroll_vitals2 %>% mutate(
  measBetween0_68 = ifelse(MEASURE_DATE > firstDispDate & MEASURE_DATE <= firstDispPlus68W, 1, 0),
  measBetweenN8_0 = ifelse(MEASURE_DATE > firstDispDate - weeks(8) & MEASURE_DATE <= firstDispDate, 1, 0)
)

disp_enroll_vitals3 %>% select(STUDY_ID, firstDispDate, MEASURE_DATE , measBetween0_68, measBetweenN8_0) %>% distinct()
```
## Still need to get # of distinct patients with at least one wt in (-8,0] and at least one wt in (0,68]
```{r}
# disp_enroll_vitals3[,c('STUDY_ID', 'measBetween0_68', 'measBetweenN8_0')] %>% 
#   group_by(STUDY_ID) %>%
#   filter(colSums(disp_enroll_vitals3) >= 1) %>% 
#   distinct(STUDY_ID)


disp_enroll_vitals3 %>% filter(
  measBetween0_68 == 1
)

disp_enroll_vitals3 %>% filter(
  measBetweenN8_0 == 1
)

```
If we only include people who have at least one wt in (-8,0] AND at least one wt in (0,68], we would have at most 2526 patients. 

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# next to do:
# pick one weight for those with differing weights on same measure_date ###############complete############
# look at potentially erroneous weights and their proportions  ###############complete############
# make time windows ###############complete############

#### draft 5 is good to rely on (after correcting it so that only 72+ firstDispToEndW are included). numbers should be similar, but will be slightly different 
#### since this draft has 18+ y/o only and includes demographic & death table additionally 5
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Some STUDY_ID and MEASURE_DATE pairings that have multiple different WT values
```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals3 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE, WT, ORIGINAL_BMI) %>% nrow()
disp_enroll_vitals3 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE) %>% nrow()
```
960 duplicated rows

## Choosing one random weight & ORIGINAL_BMI per MEASURE_DATE for patients who have 2+ different WTs/BMIs per MEASURE_DATE

A look at the structure of the data
```{r}
# arranging by MEASURE_DATE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
disp_enroll_vitals3 %>% select(STUDY_ID, DISPENSE_DATE, MEASURE_DATE, WT,  firstDispDate) %>% arrange(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE)


# arranging by DISPENSE_DATE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
disp_enroll_vitals3 %>% select(STUDY_ID, DISPENSE_DATE, MEASURE_DATE, WT,  firstDispDate) %>% arrange(STUDY_ID, DISPENSE_DATE)

Taking the first slice when grouping by STUDY_ID only grabs the observation from the first DISPENSE_DATE per person, which is okay.
We will also only be looking at the first dispensed drug for the drug breakdown chart. 

```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals4 %>% filter(DISPENSE_DATE != firstDispDate)
```


# To see the specific rows with 2+ WT measures, we will temporarily drop DISPENSE_DATE and drug in a table called disp_enroll_vitals_A (to prevent repopulated/redundant rows)
```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals_A <- disp_enroll_vitals3 %>% select(-c(DISPENSE_DATE, drug)) %>% distinct(); disp_enroll_vitals_A


disp_enroll_vitals_A %>% group_by(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE) %>% slice(2) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(STUDY_ID) # a check of number of differing measures

disp_enroll_vitals_A %>% group_by(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE) %>% slice(3) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(STUDY_ID)# one MEASURE_DATE has 3 differing measures

disp_enroll_vitals_A %>% group_by(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE) %>% slice(4) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(STUDY_ID)


disp_enroll_vitals_B <- disp_enroll_vitals_A %>% group_by(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE) %>% slice(1) %>% group_by(STUDY_ID); disp_enroll_vitals_B
```

* 823 distinct patients have at least 1 instance of 2 different weights per same MEASURE_DATE

* 17 distinct patients have at least 1 instance of 3 different weights per same MEASURE_DATE

## We will carry on with using disp_enroll_vitals4 which contains the 4450 patients, this time with only one unique wt per measure_date
```{r}
identical(disp_enroll_vitals4 %>% select(-c(DISPENSE_DATE, drug)), disp_enroll_vitals_B)
```

## Getting rid of DISPENSE_DATE column
```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals3 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID, DISPENSE_DATE)
disp_enroll_vitals4 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID, DISPENSE_DATE)


identical(disp_enroll_vitals4, disp_enroll_vitals4 %>% filter(DISPENSE_DATE == firstDispDate)) # true



disp_enroll_vitals5 = disp_enroll_vitals4 %>% select(-DISPENSE_DATE)
```

## Checking that each MEASURE_DATE now has one distinct WT and BMI
```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals5 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE, WT, ORIGINAL_BMI) 

disp_enroll_vitals5 %>% distinct(STUDY_ID, MEASURE_DATE)
```

## Proportion of potentially erroneous body weight measurements
```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals5 %>% filter(below70WT == 1 | above700WT ==1)
```

6235/142540 (4.37%) weights are potentially erroneous. 
1268/4420 (28.69%) patients have at least one potentially erroneous measurement. 

## Now we can make a body weight value histogram
## Six-number-summary of body weight values
(each patient contributes 1 body weight values PER measurement date they have. E.G: Patient A has 5 MEASURE_DATEs and thus will contribute 5 (same or different) weight values)
```{r}
# summary of all weights
summary(disp_enroll_vitals5$WT)

ggplot(disp_enroll_vitals5, aes(WT)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "blue", fill = "white") + 
  labs(x = "Weight (lbs)", 
       title = "Distribution of weight values")
```

## What if we made all the potentially erroneous weights as NA?
```{r}
NAPotentialErroneous = disp_enroll_vitals5 %>%
  mutate(WT = ifelse(
    below70WT == 1 | above700WT ==1,
    NA,
    WT
  ))


NAPotentialErroneous %>% select(STUDY_ID, WT, below70WT, above700WT)



```
## After setting all potentially erroneous weights to NA and dropping them....
```{r}
NAPotentialErroneous %>% drop_na(WT)
```

We have 136,305 weights total and 4418 distinct patients.

### Define new df as NAPotentialErroneous after dropping NA wts
```{r}
disp_enroll_vitals6 = NAPotentialErroneous %>% drop_na(WT)
```


## Six-number-summary of body weight values only wts between 70 & 700
(each patient contributes 1 body weight values PER measurement date they have. E.G: Patient A has 5 MEASURE_DATEs and thus will contribute 5 (same or different) weight values)
```{r}
# summary of all weights
summary(disp_enroll_vitals6$WT)

ggplot(disp_enroll_vitals6, aes(WT)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = "blue", fill = "white") + 
  labs(x = "Weight (lbs)", 
       title = "Distribution of weight values")
